# 100 Days Of Code: Coding Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Added functionality to calculator keys

**Thoughts:** Thankfully I remembered Wes Bos's lesson on a drum pad, which helped with the event listener for the calculator keys.

### Day 3: January 3, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Added click event listeners

**Thoughts:** I had a look at some tutorials out there, and it seems they're focusing more on clicking the keys than using keydown event listeners, so I thought I'd start with this first before working on keydown.
