# 100 Days Of Code: Coding Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Added functionality to calculator keys

**Thoughts:** Thankfully I remembered Wes Bos's lesson on a drum pad, which helped with the event listener for the calculator keys.

### Day 3: January 3, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Added click event listeners

**Thoughts:** I had a look at some tutorials out there, and it seems they're focusing more on clicking the keys than using keydown event listeners, so I thought I'd start with this first before working on keydown.

### Day 5: January 6, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Added operator keys

**Thoughts:** Had to skip a day due to work, a bit bummed about that, but oh well. Had a realization today that the tutorials I'm looking at only deals with two operands, which might not be ideal if I want my calculator to function more like a regular calculator that can take more than two operands. Need to rethink the code and made tweaks.

### Day 6: January 7, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Pretty much finished the click event listeners

**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty accomplished as I finished most of the click event listeners. Just got to figure out the memory keys, but that can wait.
